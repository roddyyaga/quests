  (* High-level description of algorithm:
      * Submit data to be processed to input stream
      * Join queue of threads waiting for outputs
      * If there is a thread ahead of us:
          * Sleep and wait for it to wake us up when it is our turn
      * Get response from output stream
      * Remove us from queue
      * If there is a thread behind us:
          * Wake it up
      * Return response

   * Notes:
      * [queue_lock] is taken before performing operations that rely on or change the length of the queue, to stop various obvious race conditions
      * [wakeup_lock] is used to stop the following race:
          * Thread 1 adds its condition variable to the queue, behind thread 2
          * Thread 2 pops itself from the queue and signals thread 1
          * Thread 1 waits on the condition variable,
          * but the signal has already happened so it will never wake
